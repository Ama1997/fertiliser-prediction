# Predicting Optimal Fertilizers for Crops

This project was created as a submission to the **Predicting Optimal Fertilizers** challenge in  
**Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 6** on Kaggle.

## Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict the best fertilizer based on:

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Moisture  
- Soil type  
- Crop type  
- Nitrogen  
- Phosphorus  
- Potassium  

## Dataset

Provided by the competition:

- **Training set** with known fertilizer labels  
- **Test set** without labels for evaluation  

## Workflow

1. Load and explore the data  
2. Preprocess features (encode categories, scale values)  
3. Train and tune models  
4. Evaluate performance  
5. Generate predictions for submission  

## Models Used

- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Open the notebook  
4. Run all cells to reproduce the results
